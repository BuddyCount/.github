## Why BuddyCount?

Imagine you're going on a ski trip with your friends. Bob paid for the lift tickets, Alice paid the gas, and you paid for the hotel. Its only day one, and you already have to do _scientific calculations_ to make sure no one's paying an unfair amount. You're the only one who's "good" with maths, so you're tasked with calculating how much each of you owes to the others. There you are: on holidays, and still doing maths...

But fear not: **_BuddyCount_ is there for you** ! It's a user-friendly app that helps you keep track of who owes what automatically. No more maths, no more headaches, no more stress.
